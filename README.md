High-resolution Child Poverty Maps in Iraq
==============================

Child poverty is a complex issue that long-lasting effects on individuals and societies. To understand where deprived children are mostly located, we develop a workflow to disaggregate subnational (ADM1) estimates at the ADM2 level. To do so, we operationalize satellite image, using the efficient MOSAIKS features that capture the complex information of satellite images in ready-to-use features. The focus of this work is Iraq.
